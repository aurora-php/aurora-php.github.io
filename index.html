            <h1>about octris</h1>
        
            <p>
                Octris is an experimental/toy framework and class-library developed by me - <a href="https://github.com/aurora/">Harald Lapp</a>. It's main purpose is for learning and experimenting. In this regards it's probably unstable and not recommended for use in productive environments. Its API is not garanteed to be stable across releases. It lacks documentation and tests. I do not advertise this and i do not care about a broad adoption, quite the contrary is true. Because of this reasons, the packages of this library are not published on packagist.org, but can be installed using my own repository located at <a href="https://octris.github.io/composer/">https://octris.github.io/composer/</a>.
